# onlineclass_bot

Hi Everyone.
I am a student of MIT ADT and I have Created a bot to automate the process of joining online lectures.

If you are a Student of MIT ADT, and if you currently in CSE2 Second year, then you can use the code by just changing the username and password.
Else, You have to make changes, because timetable is different and the links too.

Right here, I am showing you how to change the links and the timetable.

1. Download timetable.xlsx and make changes in it according to your timetable. Prefer giving short names, like DS for data structures. (DO NOW CHANGE THE FORMAT)
2. Now we have to make changes in the code.
3. We have to make changes at line 11 of code. That is lecture dictionary.
4. Replace my subject names with that of yours. { Remember, the naming should match with the one you entered in timetable.xlsx }
5. Now we need to change the value of the dictionary. { link of subjects }
